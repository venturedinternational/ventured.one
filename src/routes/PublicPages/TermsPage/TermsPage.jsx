        YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH COMPANY AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH
        YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Binding Arbitration. </b>
          Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or
          proceedings (collectively, <b>“Disputes”</b>) in which either Party seeks injunctive or
          other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property,
          including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade
          secrets or patents, you and Company (i) waive your and Company’s respective rights
          to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these Terms resolved in a court,
          and (ii) waive your and Company’s respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and
          Company will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a
          Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and
          binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or
          jury in court).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions. </b>
          Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to you and Company and
          will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a
          class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There
          will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a
          Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a
          Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether
          within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Federal Arbitration Act. </b>
          The enforceability of this Section 14 will be both substantively and procedurally governed
          by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1
          et seq. (the <b>“FAA”</b>), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

            Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution.
          </b>
          Each Party will notify the other Party in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) days
          of the date it arises, so that the Parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute
          informally. Notice to Company shall be sent by e-mail to Company at info@Ventured.one.
          Notice to you shall be by email to the then-current email address in your Account.
          Your notice must include (i) your name, postal address, email address and telephone
          number, (ii) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute,
          and (iii) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and Company cannot agree how
          to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the
          applicable Party, then either you or Company may, as appropriate and in accordance with
          this Section 14, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically
          provided for in Section 14(a), file a claim in court.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any arbitration will occur in San Francisco County, California. Arbitration will be
          conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the
          Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (<b>“JAMS”</b>), which are hereby incorporated
          by reference. The state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California
          will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration
          award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county
          where you reside if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Authority of Arbitrator. </b>
          As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will
          have (i) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive
          decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is
          arbitrable, and (ii) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available
          in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct
          a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms.
          The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more
          than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding
          or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Rules of JAMS. </b>
          The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the
          <a href='http://www.jamsadr.com/' rel='nofollow'>JAMS website</a>. By agreeing to be bound
          by these Terms, you either (i) acknowledge
          and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS, or (ii) waive your
          opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair
          or should not apply for any reason.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Severability of Dispute Resolution; Arbitration. </b>
          If any term, clause or provision of this Section 14 is held invalid or unenforceable,
          it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms,
          clauses and provisions of this Section 14 will remain valid and enforceable. Further,
          the waivers set forth in Section 14(b) are severable from the other provisions of these
          Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.

        Exhibit A
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Description of Company, Platform, and VCN
      </h3>
      <h3>
        1. Overview of Company and Affiliates
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Company is an exempted company with limited liability incorporated in Delware and is
        not subject to supervision or regulation by the Delaware Monetary Authority.
        Company will have primary responsibility for the provision of Services and for administering
        the development of certain aspects of the Platform.
        As part of a strategic r.ioanization, the Company and its corporate affiliates decided to
        provide the Services, and to administer development of related Platform components, from
        Company rather than Ventured. Ventured will continue to have primary responsibility for
        developing components of the Platform unrelated to the Services.  It is anticipated that
        Ventured and other corporate affiliates will provide certain administrative, technical and
        development services to Company in connection with the Services and Platform.
      </p>
      <h3>
        2. Overview of Current Platform
      </h3>
      <p>
        Currently, the Network consists of a platform (the <b>“Ventured Platform”</b>) and
        data science algorithms. The Ventured Network, which launched in 2017, is building a Network
        Layer of smart work contracts and pre-trained models to give people the necessary information
        to make optimal choices about their work. Empowering people to choose their best work will
        mean individuals are no longer bound by companies.
      </p>
      <h3>
        3. Development of Platform with VCN Functionality and Services
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Company now intends to introduce new components into the Platform in the form of
        VCN and an accompanying VCN wallet (together, “VCN Functionality”).  VCN is based on the
        Ethereum protocol and conforms to the ERC20 standard. As a result of introducing VCN
        Functionality into the Platform, the Platform will integrate and consist of VCN Functionality,
        the Ventured Browser, and the Ventured Platform.  VCN will be the utility token
        for conducting transactions and obtaining Services on the Platform.
        Currently, it is anticipated that the primary services (“Services”) to be facilitated through
        VCN and the Platform, as developed and made available by Company, will relate to organization
        creation, dynamic cryptocurrency generation  and other smart contract uses. Further details
        regarding the Platform are described in the Venture Coin Whitepaper (“Whitepaper”), which
        is available at: <a href='https://github.com/venturedinternational/whitepaper'>https://github.com/venturedinternational/whitepaper</a>.
        The information contained in the Whitepaper and Ventured’s website are of descriptive nature only,
        and do not, unless explicitly incorporated herein, form part of the Terms.
        Although Company intends to develop the Platform in the manner generally described above,
        it reserves the right to modify features, functionalities or development plans in its sole
        and absolute discretion.
      </p>
      <h2 className='section-header'>
        Exhibit B
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Certain Risks Relating to Purchase, Sale and Use of VCN
      </h3>
      <p>
        <b>Important Note:</b>  As noted elsewhere in these Terms, the VCN are not being structured
        or sold as securities or any other form of investment product.  Accordingly, none of
        the information presented in this Exhibit B is intended to form the basis for any
        investment decision, and no specific recommendations are intended. Company expressly
        disclaims any and all responsibility for any direct or consequential loss or damage of
        any kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from: (i) reliance on any information
        contained in this <b>Exhibit B</b>, (ii) any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such information
        or (iii) any action resulting from such information.
        <b> By purchasing, holding and using VCN, you expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks:</b>
      </p>
      <h3>
        1. Risk of Losing Access to VCN Due to Loss of Private Key(s), Custodial Error or Purchaser Error
      </h3>
      <p>
        A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of VCN
        stored in your digital wallet or vault.  Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s)
        associated with your digital wallet or vault storing VCN will result in loss of such VCN.
        Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining
        access to login credentials of a digital wallet or vault service you use, may be able to
        misappropriate your VCN.  Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the
        digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store VCN, including your own failure to
        properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your VCN.
      </p>
      <h3>
        2.Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol
      </h3>
      <p>
        Because VCN and the Platform are based on the Ethereum protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment
        of the Ethereum protocol may have a material adverse effect on the Platform or VCN.  Moreover, advances in
        cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to VCN
        and the Platform, including the utility of VCN for obtaining Services, by rendering ineffective the cryptographic
        consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol.
      </p>
      <h3>
        3. Risk of Mining Attacks
      </h3>
      <p>
        As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum protocol, VCN are susceptible to attacks
        by miners in the course of validating VCN transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but not limited,
        to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present
        a risk to the Platform and VCN, including, but not limited to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving VCN.
      </p>
      <h3>
        4. Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses
      </h3>
      <p>
        Hackers or other malicious groups or.ioanizations may attempt to interfere with the Platform
        or VCN in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of
        service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing.  Furthermore,
        because the Platform is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or
        a member of the Company team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into
        the core infrastructure of the Platform, which could negatively affect the Platform and VCN,
        including VCN’s utility for obtaining Services.
      </p>
      <h3>
        5. Risks Associated with Markets for VCN
      </h3>
      <p>
        VCN are intended to be used solely on the Platform, and Company will not support or otherwise
        facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of VCN.  This restricts the contemplated
        avenues for using VCN to obtain Services or access the Platform, and could therefore create
        illiquidity risk with respect to VCN you hold.  Even if secondary trading of VCN is facilitated
        by third party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no
        regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to market-related risks.  Furthermore, to
        the extent that third-parties do ascribe an external exchange value to VCN (e.g., as denominated
        in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero.
      </p>
      <h3>
        6. Risk of Uninsured Losses
      </h3>
      <p>
        Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, VCN are uninsured
        unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them.  Thus, in the event of
        loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer, such as the Federal Deposit
        Insurance Corporation, or private insurance arranged by us, to offer recourse to you.
      </p>
      <h3>
        7. Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions
      </h3>
      <p>
        The regulatory status of VCN and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in
        many jurisdictions.  It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply
        existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications.  It is likewise
        difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes
        to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications,
        including the Platform and VCN. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Platform
        and VCN in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination
        that VCN are a regulated financial instrument that require registration or licensing.
        Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or
        changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially
        undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <h3>
        8. Risks Arising from Taxation
      </h3>
      <p>
        The tax characterization of VCN is uncertain.  You must seek your own tax advice in
        connection with purchasing VCN, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you,
        including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements.
      </p>
      <h3>
        9. Risk of Alternative Platforms
      </h3>
      <p>
        It is possible that alternative platforms could be established that utilize the same
        open source code and protocol underlying the Platform and attempt to facilitate services
        that are materially similar to the Services. The Platform may compete with these alternative
        platforms, which could negatively impact the Platform and VCN, including VCN’s utility for
        obtaining Services.
      </p>
      <h3>
        10. Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Platform or Distributed Applications
      </h3>
      <p>
        It is possible that the Platform will not be used by a large number of individuals,
        companies and other entities or that there will be limited public interest in the
        creation and development of distributed platforms (such as the Platform) more generally.
        Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the development of the Platform and
        the potential utility of VCN, including its utility for obtaining Services.
      </p>
      <h3>
        11. Risks Associated with the Development and Maintenance of the Platform
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Platform is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time.
        Although we intend for VCN and the Platform to follow the specifications set forth in
        <b>Exhibit A</b>, and will take commercially reasonable steps toward those ends, we may
        have to make changes to the specifications of VCN or the Platform for any number of
        legitimate reasons.  This could create the risk that VCN or the Platform, as further
        developed and maintained, may not meet your expectations at the time of purchasing VCN.
        Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain the Platform, it is
        still possible that the Platform will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be
        adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the Platform and the potential
        utility of VCN, including its utility for obtaining Services.
      </p>
      <h3>
        12. Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of Ether and Other Currency Value
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Company team intends to use the proceeds from selling VCN to fund the maintenance
        and development of the Platform, as described further in Section 6 of <b>Exhibit B</b>.
        The proceeds of the sale of VCN will be denominated in Ether, and may, at our discretion,
        be converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. If the value of Ether or other
        currencies fluctuates unfavorably during or after the Sale Period, the Company team may not
        be able to fund development, or may not be able to develop or maintain the Platform in the
        manner that it intended.
      </p>
      <h3>
        13. Risk of Dissolution of the Company
      </h3>
      <p>
        It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to,
        an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of Ether (or other cryptographic and fiat currencies),
        decrease in VCN’s utility (including its utility for obtaining Services), the failure of
        commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Platform may
        no longer be viable to operate and the Company may dissolve.
      </p>
      <h3>
        14. Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights
      </h3>
      <p>
        Because VCN confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Platform or
        Company, all decisions involving the Platform or Company will be made by Company at
        its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue the Platform,
        to sell more VCN for use in the Platform, or to sell or liquidate the Company.
        These decisions could adversely affect the Platform and the utility of VCN that you hold,
        including VCN’s utility for obtaining Services.
      </p>
      <h3>
        15. Unanticipated Risks
      </h3>
      <p>
        Cryptographic tokens such as VCN are a new and untested technology. In addition to the
        risks included in this <b>Exhibit B</b>, there are other risks associated with your purchase,
        holding and use of VCN, including those that the Company cannot anticipate. Such risks
        may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed
        in this <b>Exhibit C</b>.
